## Game Summary

Cribbage is a classic (usually 2-player, but possibly more) card game that involves a 52 card deck, and usually a cribbage board and small pegs for the board. 

This game was and is a staple in my house growing up, and I play it with my dad frequently to this day. It is fairly simple in theory, but involves many subtleties, strategy and gambling to score the maximum amount of points each round. 

I wanted to build a browser version so that my dad could play even when I'm not around - and I can practice in the hopes of one day beating him!

This version involves a human player against a computer and includes some modifications to the rules. 

I wanted to create a simple design, with minimal distractions for both my dad, and so that it could also eventually be used as a teaching tool for someone who wants to learn how to play.

## Challenges/Future Goals:
- Finalizing the gameplay logic; there are many nuances and subleties - so I created a very basic version and plan to update it to the point of a full version of the game and expanding levels of difficulty
- Incorporating the gameboard & peg movement UI as the score increases
- Mobile Design version
