## Classic Cribbage game brought to life online!
================================================

## Game Summary

Cribbage is a classic (usually 2-player, but possibly more) card game that involves a 52 card deck, and usually a cribbage board and small pegs for the board.

This game was and is a staple in my house growing up, it is fairly simple in theory, but involves many subtleties, strategy and gambling to score the maximum amount of points each round.

### How to Play

1. To start, players cut the deck and highest card drawn becomes the first dealer. After each round, the dealer switches.
2. Dealer hands out 6 cards for each player
3. Each player contributes 2 cards from their respective hands to what is called the "crib" - face-down. The crib is "owned" by whoever is dealer and switches each round of play. It is essentially "extra" points for the dealer at the end of round.
4. The pone (or non-dealer) then cuts the deck and flips the starter card - the starter card is used at the end of the round to count points.
5. The pone starts - flipping up a card of their choice - and says the value out loud (face cards are 10, Ace is 1) - then the dealer places a card face-up, repeating until they either reach 31 or the cards left in their hands would go over 31. Points can be gained throughout play according to some rules.
6. During play, as you're totaling the count to 31, if you place a card and total is 15, you score 2 points. For a pair, 2 points, etc. For a run of 3 or more, 1 point per card in the run.
7. Once all cards are played, the 2nd round of scoring begins using their original hands. 
8. You use the pegs to keep track of the score around the board.

### Scoring Points
* The starter card is used to "fill" out each hand - players can both use the 5th card to add to their points
* A total of 15 is 2 points (Jack + 5, 10 + 2 + 3, etc)
* Pairs are worth 2; therefore 3 of a kind is 6 points (3 sets of pairs)
* Runs of 3 cards total or higher are 1 point per card
* Right Jack or "nobs" - if the Jack suit matches the suit of the starter card, 1 point
* Flush - 4 card flush is 4 points, can not include the starter card

### How to Win
The first person to reach 121 points wins the game - if you are playing on a cribbage board, the first person to "cross the finish line" wins. 

Bonus: If you cross the finish line before your opponent reaches the halfway mark - they've been skunked!

## Challenges:
- Using event listeners and handlers to find elements of various arrays
- Creating the gameplay logic; there are many nuances and subleties - so I created a very basic version and plan to update it to the point of a full version of the game and expanding levels of difficulty

## Further Developments
- Building a cribbage board in JS
- Adding additional animations to see scoring more visually
